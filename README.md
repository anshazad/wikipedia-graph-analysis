# wikipedia-graph-analysis

Scraped Wikipedia data to create a Wikipedia graph and train a neural network to predict the difficulty of the page's content.
Recommending topics to study before learning a topic based on the level of difficulty of the page

First we Scrape and Label articles according to complexity for someone who are preparing of JEE. The links are here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A8G-00Y8yIR6XCm3xf-tAWF2Z_WwU13R6gS8SzEqzGU/edit#gid=0.
Then we have to build the wikipedia graph along with attributes and labels. 
Additional features have also been added using concepts like centrality metrics, clustering coefficient, etc
