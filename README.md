# wikipedia-graph-analysis

Scraped Wikipedia data(Mathematics concepts) to create a Wikipedia graph and train a neural network to predict the difficulty of the page's content.
Recommending topics to study before learning a topic based on the level of difficulty of the page

First we Scrape and Label articles according to complexity. The links are here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15IF7BaN18UxGTuE-nzxYm3wDhdhlfm3t/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103200904413181459658&rtpof=true&sd=true
Then we have to build the wikipedia graph along with attributes and labels. 
Additional features have also been added using concepts like centrality metrics, clustering coefficient, etc
